//! Alignment operations
//!
//! Alignment operations are used to arrange two [`View`]s relative to each other. A single [`align_*`]
//! call requires both a `horizontal` and a `vertical` alignment parameter.
//!
//! The list of currently supported alignments:
//!  - [`horizontal`]
//!    - `NoAlignment`, `Left`, `Center`, `Right`
//!    - `LeftToRight`
//!    - `RightToLeft`
//!  - [`vertical`]
//!    - `NoAlignment`, `Top`, `Center`, `Bottom`
//!    - `TopToBottom`
//!    - `BottomToTop`
//!
//! Alignment works by calling [`align_to`] or [`align_to_mut`] on an object that implements
//! the [`Align`] trait. The call needs a second [`View`] to align to, called the reference [`View`],
//! and two alignment parameters. The second [`View`] will not be translated by the alignment
//! operation.
//!
